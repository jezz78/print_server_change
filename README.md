# print_server_change
A simple AutoIT script to disconnect network printers and connect them again with new print server name in Windows enviroment.
My goal was to make it without user interaction. After initial batch file failure, I change to compiled to .exe AutoIT script. Next I distribute it via email to the users as a link to network share they have to run.
